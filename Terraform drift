Drift occurs when the actual infrastructure state differs from the Terraform state file due to manual changes.

Detecting Drift:
terraform plan
terraform refresh
terraform plan -refresh-only
Fixing Drift:
# Revert to Terraform config
terraform apply

# Or update Terraform to match reality
terraform refresh
