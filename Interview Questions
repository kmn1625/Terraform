Q1: What is Terraform and why use it?

A: Terraform is an IaC tool for infrastructure provisioning. Benefits include version control, multi-cloud support, and automation.

Q2: Explain Terraform state file

A: State file maps Terraform configuration to real resources. It tracks metadata, dependencies, and improves performance.

Q3: What happens if state file is lost?

A: Terraform loses resource tracking. Solutions: restore from backup, import resources, or recover from remote state.

Q4: Difference between plan and apply?

A: Plan shows what changes will be made (dry run). Apply actually creates/modifies/destroys resources.

Q5: What is infrastructure drift?

A: Drift is when actual infrastructure differs from state file due to manual changes. Detect using terraform plan or refresh.

Q6: Explain provisioners

A: Provisioners execute scripts during resource creation. Types: file, local-exec, remote-exec. Use as last resort.

Q7: What is state locking?

A: State locking prevents concurrent operations. Prevents corruption in team environments. Use DynamoDB with S3.

Q8: Count vs for_each?

A: Count creates by index. For_each creates by key. For_each is more stable when removing resources.

Q9: How to manage secrets?

A: Use environment variables, AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault. Never commit secrets to Git.

Q10: What is Terragrunt?

A: Terraform wrapper that helps keep code DRY, manages remote state, and handles multiple environments.
